# Installation

To install the required libraries run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Dependency information has been saved using the PIP module [pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs). This writes only the dependencies the project needs to the `requirements.txt` file and not all that are installed on the system.

# Usage

In order to use PyBici you will need to create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
LATITUDE_COORD = YOUR_LATITUDE_COORD
LONGITUDE_COORD = YOUR_LONGITUDE_COORD
```

Once done this, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python3 run.py
```

You will see an output like the following:

```bash
Requesting bike stops within its occupation...
Obtained response. Now calculating the closest stops...

The closest three stops with bikes are:
********************************************************
        Avd de la Libertad: 1 bikes ðŸš²
        Avd Juan Carlos I: 1 bikes ðŸš²
        Santo Domingo: 2 bikes ðŸš²
********************************************************
Have a good ride!
```
