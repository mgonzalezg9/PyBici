# Technologies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
- [SMTPLib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)

# Installation

To install the required libraries run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Dependency information has been saved using the PIP module [pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs). This writes only the dependencies the project needs to the `requirements.txt` file and not all that are installed on the system.

# Usage

In order to use PyBici you will need to create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
EMAIL_SENDER = YOUR_EMAIL
EMAIL_RECEIVER = YOUR_EMAIL
EMAIL_PASSWORD = YOUR_PASSWORD
EMAIL_STMP_SERVICE = YOUR_SMTP_SERVICE
EMAIL_STMP_PORT = YOUR_SMTP_PORT

```

Once done this, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python3 run.py <latitude> <longitude>
```

You will see an output like the following:

```
Requesting bike stops within its occupation...
Obtained response. Now calculating the closest stops...

The closest three stops with bikes are:
********************************************************
        Avd de la Libertad: 1 bikes ðŸš²
        Avd Juan Carlos I: 1 bikes ðŸš²
        Santo Domingo: 2 bikes ðŸš²
********************************************************
Have a good ride!
```
